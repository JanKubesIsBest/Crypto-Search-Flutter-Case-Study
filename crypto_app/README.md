# Plan 
As I know that the "Mobile Developer" position expects a knowledge of english, I will write this in English.

At the end of the day, my school is heavy english based and I write most of my code in english, so this should not be a problem. 

## Plan
Technologies: 
- Flutter (Ofcourse :D)
- SQLite database 
    - I have worked with SQLite multiple times and we had a big project on it recently in school. 
    - I'm going to make a SQL er diagram, so we can keep things simple and clean. 
- Crypto API
    - [[Coin Gecko](https://docs.coingecko.com)]

### Design
I'm going to start with light theme, but if there is enough time, I can do dark theme as well.

#### Menu
- Page view builder
    - First page: trending
    - Second page: favourites
        - Searched via ID from SQL database

#### Search bar
- Updates continously 
- Searched items are like a widget
- Something like Trading 212
